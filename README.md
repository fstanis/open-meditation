# Open Meditation repository [![Open Content](https://opendefinition.org/assets.okfn.org/images/ok_buttons/oc_80x15_blue.png "Open Content")](https://opendefinition.org/)

This repo hosts resources related to meditation and mindfulness that are "open" as defined in the [Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/).

> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).

The goal is to make these resources easier to find, distribute and use in other open source projects.
